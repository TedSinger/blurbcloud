yo yo yo

i am still annoying you.

cannot stop it until you promise me

that sometime later we'll be friends again.

(you can always lie or change idea though. )

just give me a thumb-up or smily face and that i know we are cool?

you keep blocking me makes me feel more uneasy/anxious. 

i'll buy you your favorite board games each year? 

deal?
